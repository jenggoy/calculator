Alright, so check it out: I'm rolling solo on this project "CalcIt" for my web dev class. It's just me, my code, and a whole lot of TypeScript magic. I'm crafting this slick calculator from scratch, adding in all the bells and whistles to make math a breeze. With dynamic updates, smooth animations, and maybe a pop of color, I'm turning my vision into reality one line of code at a time. It's all about diving deep into the dev world, honing my skills, and owning this project like a boss.
